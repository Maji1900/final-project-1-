      <h1>
        In Black Culture, hair is considered a deeply significant symbol of identity, heritage and cultural pride.
      </h1>

      <p>
        During the transatlantic slave trade, enslaved Africans were forcibly shaved, stripping them of a key cultural identifier, making hair regrowth and styling a symbol of reclaiming identity. The "afro" became a prominent symbol of Black Pride and rebellion against oppressive beauty standards during the Civil Rights era. Diffrent hairstyles like braids, twist, and banyu knots carry specific cultural meanings, often times signifying family lineage, tride, or life events.nWearing natural hair without conforming to Eurocentric expectations is seen as an act of enpowerment and resistance against societal pressures.
